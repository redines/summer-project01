# summer-project01
My first simple projekt over the course of summer 2018. Worked on this during my spare time with the goal of practising simple concepts from creating a backend to fetching data and presenting it on a frontend.

# What I did
simple MySQL database that stores words and amount of times a said word was used.
PHP backend to do MySQL requests both standard and custom querys with data from a form.
Javascript creates AJAX requests and presents data on a classic HTML/CSS webpage.
